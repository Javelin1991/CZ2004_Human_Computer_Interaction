# CZ2004 : Human Computer Interaction

## Brief Description
I have learnt how interaction between human and computer works as well as rules to follow when designing a UI such as **"Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"**. As a result, I have become capable of thinking from both a software developer's perspective and a user's perspective when designing prototypes for UI.
