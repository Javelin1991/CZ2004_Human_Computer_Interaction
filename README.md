# CZ2004 : Human Computer Interaction

## Brief Description
I have learnt how interaction between human and computer works as well as rules to follow when designing a UI such as **"Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"**. As a result, I have become capable of thinking from both a software developer's perspective and a user's perspective when designing prototypes for UI. 

## Coursework Assignment

Based on coursework assignment specifications and requirements, I have designed two versions of UI prototypes for an advanced To-Do List Application that includes features like task dependencies. The design has to follow "Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design". 

The coursework involves two versions of UI prototypes as follows: 
- Low-Fidelity Prototype
- High-Fidelity Prototype


## Knowledge Accquired includes: 

1.	Usability and application spaces

2.	Guidelines for navigation, organization, attention and data entry

3.	Prototyping and evaluating interface designs

4.	Understanding humans

5.	Modelling users

6.	Human-computer interfaces

7.	Interaction and design analysis
